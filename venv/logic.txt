Assume there is a Hospital, 
with multiple departments and each department has 1 or more doctors. 
You need to create a web based token system for visitors based on this information.

Requirements:
There should be 2 endpoints(portal) in this system 1. one visitor's end(portal) and   2. other hospital end(portal).

In Visitor's end -
   * users should be able to select a department (not doctor) and create appointments. 
   * Just name, and mobile number input is enough to create an appointment. Use POST requests for input.
   * When a user creates an appointment they should be assigned with a token starting from 1, until a predefined capacity. 
     If a department have more than 1 doctor, appointments should be equally distributed among those doctors.

In the Hospital end -
   * you should show a list of appointments. Search option by name or mobile number should be there.
   * also option to group appointments by doctor.
   
You can use any backend framework like Django or flask. You can tweak the front end if you have time. Otherwise not necessary.
